**Ribosome Function**

A dictionary consisting of RNA codons and amino acids was prepared and the codon-aa.txt file was used.
Read the sequence in the Seq.txt file as a string in Python.
A function was written that takes an RNA sequence and a dictionary as optional arguments.
The function found the amino acid sequence of the gene region using the RNA sequence and the dictionary.
Tested with default values ​​and the amino acid sequence was written to a file.

**Missense Mutations**

Wrote a function that takes three arguments: an RNA sequence, a codon-amino acid dictionary, and a point mutation in the RNA
The function called the function written in Ribosom_functions.py to convert the RNA sequence into an amino acid sequence.
The index of the amino acid affected by the mutation was returned and if the amino acid changed, this was documented.

**Standardization** 

The data file 'gene_expression.txt' contains gene expression values ​​of genes in 5 replicates from an RNA-seq experiment.
Standardized expression values ​​and got list of numbers
